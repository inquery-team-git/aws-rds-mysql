# {{ .Name }} Operator Guide

This is the guide for your bundle. It will appear under the `guide` button in Massdriver.

Use it to describe to users how the bundle works, use cases for the bundle, and event examples.

Decisions:
* A 10 character password is automatically generated for your root account
* Auto minor version upgrade enabled
* Auto major version upgrade disabled
* A default database _is not created_
* publicly_accessible is disabled, instances run on private subnets
* encryption is enabled w/ a custom KMS key
* tags are copied to snapshots
* a subnet group is created for the database
* a security group is created for the database
* some instance types (e.g: db.t2.micro) aren't supported since they do not support encryption

<!-- We may want to polish this for template before releasing -->
